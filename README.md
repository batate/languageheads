Language Heads
=============

Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks is a book dedicated to learning languages to become a better programmer. The goal is to present a nontrivial problem for each language in the book. Language Heads is a game written in the Elm language, a reactive language that is based on Java, which compiles to JavaScript, and has a heavy Haskell influence. 

Build it
--------------
1. [Install Elm](https://github.com/evancz/Elm/blob/master/README.md#install).
2. Download Language Heads. 
3. Navigate to the languageheads directory. 
4. Run the Elm server (elm-server). 
5. Point your browser to [LanguageHeads](http://localhost:8000/languageHeads.elm). 
6. Press the space bar, and use the mouse to keep the heads in the air!
7. Stay alert! You may see some heads you recognize. 

Enhancements
------------
If you know any language creators or big names in the programming language space, ask their permission first, add a head to the package. You just need to send a 75x75 transparent png or gif, and add it to languageHeads.elm. Send a pull request. 

Or, just get permission, and send me a pull request with a photo with an interesting face in a separate directory. I'll cut it out, stamp out a head, and add it to the game. 

Happy bouncing!

Careful... don't kill any of your heros.
