Language Heads
=============

Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks is a book dedicated to learning languages to become a better programmer. The goal is to present a nontrivial problem for each language in the book. Language Heads is a game written in the Elm language, a reactive language which compiles to JavaScript and has a heavy Haskell influence. 

Build it
--------------
1. [Install Elm](https://github.com/evancz/Elm/blob/master/README.md#install).
2. Download Language Heads. 
3. Navigate to the languageheads directory. 
4. Run the Elm server (elm-server). 
5. Point your browser to [LanguageHeads](http://localhost:8000/languageHeads.elm). 
6. Press the space bar, and use the mouse to keep the heads in the air!
7. Stay alert! You may see some heads you recognize. 

Adding Famous People
--------------------
If you know any language creators or big names in the programming language space, ask their permission first, add a head to the package. You just need to send a 75x75 transparent png or gif, and add it to languageHeads.elm. Send me a note with permission and a pull request. 

Or, just get permission, and send me a pull request with a photo with an interesting face in a separate directory. I'll cut it out, stamp out a head, and add it to the game. 

Adding Enhancements
-------------------
If you're enhancing the game, just cuz, just send a pull request. There are lots of ideas to make the game better. 

1. Make something interesting that bounces the heads. Right now, we just bounce heads with a line. Boring. Might we use a hand? Firemen and a net? A rolling hospital bed? A crib? You decide...
2. It's too easy to die if you have to be two places at once. Make the head spawn avoid this. 
3. Add a randomizing element to when the heads show up. 
4. Improve the formula for when to spawn a new head. 
5. Lives. Three chances to die. 
6. Add super powers that can be used one time to save heads. You decide how to get these powers. Maybe run the paddle over them? Powers might be a button to reset gravity of all heads to zero (except the one under your paddle). A button to save the lowest head. 
7. Spin the heads. This might have an impact on movement, or not. 

Happy bouncing!

Careful... don't kill any of your heros.
